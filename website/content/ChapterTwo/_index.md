I naively thought that if I read all the LeetCode questions completely, I would be able to complete this book. Facts have proved that it is indeed naive. Because LeetCode adds new questions every day, sometimes the work is busy, and the progress of brushing the questions can't keep up with the speed of updating the questions. And with my current speed of brushing questions, I only complete 500+ questions a year, and LeetCode will update 400+ questions a year. It will take at least 5 to 10 years to finish all the questions. It's too long. So first set a small goal for yourself, write out 500 questions first, summarize the experience of brushing the questions at this stage, and communicate with everyone. If you want to finish all the topics of LeetCode, it seems that this book will have to iterate 5 to 10 versions (one version per year).
Then this chapter sorts out all the topics that have been brushed up. Questions with similar routines are put together. If you want to have a quick interview, in fact, you can do 2 or 3 of the same questions. When you are very proficient in the same type of questions, it is useless to do a few more questions.

So far, the author thinks that dynamic programming is the most flexible type. There is no template for this type of topic to apply to you, and it is also the elegance of the algorithm. The author thinks it is not an exaggeration to call it the art of algorithms. The author has not finished brushing up the type of dynamic programming, only a part of it, and I am still learning.

Then let me share the questions that the author has done so far, and the questions with similarities.
