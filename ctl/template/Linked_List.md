# Linked List

![](https://img.halfrost.com/Leetcode/Linked_List.png)

-   Clever construction of virtual head nodes. The traversal processing logic can be made more unified.
-   Flexible use of recursion. Construct recursive conditions, and use recursion to solve problems cleverly. However, it should be noted that some topics cannot use recursion, because too deep recursion will cause timeout and stack overflow.
-   The reverse order of the range of the linked list. Question 92.
-   The linked list finds the middle node. Question 876. The linked list finds the nth last node. Question 19. It only takes one traversal to get the answer.
-   Merge K ordered linked lists. Question 21, question 23.
-   Linked list sorting. Question 86, question 328.
-   Linked list sorting requires O(n \*log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. There is only one method, merge sort, and merge from top to bottom. Question 148.
-   Judging whether there is a ring in the linked list, if there is a ring, output the subscript of the intersection point of the ring; judge whether there is an intersection point in the two linked lists, and output the intersection point if there is an intersection point. Question 141, question 142, question 160.
